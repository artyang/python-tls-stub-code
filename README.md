What is mutual TLS?

TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network, most commonly used over the internet. TLS ensures that the data transmitted between two parties remains confidential, integral, and authenticated.

TLS operates at the transport layer of the network protocol stack and works on top of reliable transport protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It enables secure communication by establishing an encrypted connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a web server).

Here's a simplified overview of how TLS works:

Handshake: The TLS handshake is the initial process where the client and server establish a secure connection. The client sends a "hello" message to the server, specifying the TLS version and supported encryption algorithms. The server responds with a "hello" message, selecting the appropriate encryption parameters.

Key Exchange: The client and server exchange cryptographic keys to establish a secure session. This involves using asymmetric encryption (such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography) to securely exchange a shared secret called the "pre-master secret."

Authentication: The server presents its digital certificate during the handshake to prove its identity. The client verifies the certificate against a trusted set of certificate authorities (CAs). If the verification is successful, the client and server proceed with the connection. This step ensures that the client is communicating with the intended server and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

Symmetric Encryption: Once the handshake is complete, the client and server use the shared pre-master secret to generate a session key. This key is used for symmetric encryption and decryption of the data exchanged during the TLS session. Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption and is used for bulk data transmission.

Data Exchange: The client and server can now securely exchange data using the established session key. The data is encrypted by the sender using symmetric encryption and decrypted by the receiver using the same key, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Connection Termination: When the communication is complete, either the client or the server can initiate the termination of the TLS session. They exchange termination messages to ensure a graceful closure of the connection.

TLS supports various encryption algorithms and cipher suites, which determine the cryptographic parameters used during the handshake and data exchange. These algorithms and suites can be configured based on the desired level of security and compatibility requirements.

Overall, TLS provides a secure and reliable mechanism for protecting sensitive information during network communication, making it widely used in applications such as web browsing, email services, VPNs, and many other online services.
